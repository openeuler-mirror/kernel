Description:
		The /sys/devices/platform/HISI0521:00/ directory contains
		some attributes about memory repair capability query and execute.

		There are following attributes in this directory:

		================= ==== =========================================
		memory_type:	       (RO) memory type the device managed.
		memory_type_supported: (RO) all memory type device the driver supports.
		acls_query:	       (WO) write with physical address to check if the
					    address support ACLS repair.
					    fails with -EINVAL if input parsing fails.
					    fails with -EIO if PCC message excution failed.
					    fails with -ENXIO if the address doesn't belong this device.
					    fails with -ENOSPC if no ACLS resource left for this address.
		acls_repair:	       (WO) write with physical address to do ACLS repair.
					    fails with -EINVAL if input parsing fails.
					    fails with -EIO if PCC message excution failed.
					    fails with -ENXIO if the address doesn't belong this device.
					    fails with -ENOSPC if no ACLS resource left for this address.
		sppr_query:	       (WO) write with physical address to check if the
					    address support sPPR repair.
					    fails with -EINVAL if input parsing fails.
					    fails with -EIO if PCC message excution failed.
					    fails with -ENXIO if the address doesn't belong this device.
