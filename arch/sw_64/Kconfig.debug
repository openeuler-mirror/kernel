	help
	  This option enables special console drivers which allow the kernel
	  to print messages very early in the bootup process.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation,
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly on some machines and
	  doesn't cooperate with an X server. You should normally say N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

	  This option is required for IEEE compliant floating point arithmetic
	  on the SW. The only time you would ever not say Y is to say M in
	  order to debug the code. Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

	  Do not enable it in a production kernel.
