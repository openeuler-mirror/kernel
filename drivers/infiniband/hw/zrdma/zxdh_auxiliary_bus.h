/**
 * struct zxdh_auxiliary_driver - Definition of an auxiliary bus driver
 * @probe: Called when a matching device is added to the bus.
 * @remove: Called when device is removed from the bus.
 * @shutdown: Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device.
 * @suspend: Called to put the device to sleep mode. Usually to a power state.
 * @resume: Called to bring a device from sleep mode.
 * @name: Driver name.
 * @driver: Core driver structure.
 * @id_table: Table of devices this driver should match on the bus.
 *
 * Auxiliary drivers follow the standard driver model convention, where
 * discovery/enumeration is handled by the core, and drivers provide probe()
 * and remove() methods. They support power management and shutdown
 * notifications using the standard conventions.
 *
 * Auxiliary drivers register themselves with the bus by calling
 * zxdh_auxiliary_driver_register(). The id_table contains the match_names of
 * auxiliary devices that a driver can bind with.
