      If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

      Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
      kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
      the questions about Nebual-matrix cards. If you say Y, you will be
      asked for your specific card in the following questions.
