	  The Huawei Cache Coherence System (HCCS) is a multi-chip
	  interconnection bus protocol.
	  The performance of application may be affected if some HCCS
	  ports are not in full lane status, have a large number of CRC
	  errors and so on.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for querying the
	  health status and port information of HCCS on Kunpeng SoC.

	help
	  This driver add extra supports for memory devices. The driver
	  provides methods for userpace to control the power of memory
	  devices in a container.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called hisi_hbmdev.

	help
	  This driver provids methods to control the power of hbm cache device
	  in hisi soc. Use hbm as a cache can take advantage of hbm's high
	  bandwidth in normal memory access.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called hisi_hbmcache.

	  Last Level Cache driver for platforms such Kunpeng 920. This provides
	  interfaces to enable LLC cache lockdown.

	  If not sure say no.

config HISI_L0
	tristate "Add support L0 cache"
	depends on ARM64 && HISI_L3T
	help
	  L0 driver for platforms such Kunpeng 920. This provides interfaces to

	help
	  Add RAS driver for Hisilicon memory device to repair hardware error of
	  memory devices in OS side. The driver interacts with firmware through PCC
	  and provides sysfs files as user-mode interfaces.It could support both
	  HBM and DDR memory.

	  If not sure say no.
